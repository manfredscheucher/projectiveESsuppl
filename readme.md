# Setup 

We provide a python script `projective_ES.py` that can generate a CNF for a particular question.
One can install the interface [pysat](https://pysathq.github.io/installation/) to the solver cadical and solve the CNF directly from python via the parameter `--solver cadical`. Alternatively one can export the CNF in DIMACS form via `-o file` and run a solver like [cadical](https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical) or [gimsatul](https://github.com/arminbiere/gimsatul) manually on that instance.



# SAT framework

We extended the SAT framework from "Two Disjoint 5-Holes in Point Sets" (http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10848)
so that it can operate on projective k-gons and projective k-holes.


## projective 6-gons
`n8_no_p6g.json` encodes a set of 8 points with no projective 6-gon. 
To verify that every set of 9 points yields a projective 6-gon,
run
```
python projective_ES.py 9 6 0 --solver cadical
```
The computations take less than one CPU second.


## projective 6-holes
`n15_no_p6h.json` encodes a set of 15 points with no projective 6-hole.
To verify that every set of 16 points yields a projective 6-hole,
run
```
python projective_ES.py 16 6 1 --solver cadical
```
The computations take about 5 CPU minutes.


## projective 7-gons
`n17_no_p7g.json` encodes a set of 17 points with no projective 7-gon. 
To verify that every set of 19 points yields a projective 7-gon,
run
```
python projective_ES.py 19 7 0 -o instance_19_7_0.cnf && gimsatul instance_19_7_0.cnf --threads=32
```
The computations take about 34 CPU days in total on a 32 core machine.
