# SAT framework

We extended the SAT framework from "Two Disjoint 5-Holes in Point Sets" (http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.10848)
so that it can operate on projective k-gons and projective k-holes.


## projective 6-gons
To verify that every set of 9 points yields a projective 6-gon,
run
```
python scripts/projective_ES.py 9 6 0 --solver cadical
```
The computations take less than one CPU second.


## projective 6-holes
To verify that every set of 16 points yields a projective 6-hole,
run
```
python scripts/projective_ES.py 16 6 1 --solver cadical
```
The computations take about 10 CPU minutes.


## projective 7-gons
!!TODO!!
To verify that every set of X points yields a projective 7-gon,
run
```
python scripts/projective_ES.py 18 7 0 --solver cadical
```
The computations take about X CPU minutes.
